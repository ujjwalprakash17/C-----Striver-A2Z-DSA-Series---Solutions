1. Rotate Array K times Problem : 
    Approach - 2
    step - 1 : Reverse the last k elements
    step - 2 : Reverse the remaining first n - k elements
    step - 3 : Reverse the whole array



2. Dutch National Flag algorithm : 
    Use Case : when we need to sort 3 elements as 0 , 1 and 2, then to solve the problem in one pass 
    Algorithm ? 

    take low = 0, mid = 0, high = n - 1

    Rule : 
    0 -> low - 1 => contain 0 only
    low -> mid - 1 => contain 1 only
    mid -> high => contain unsorted elements only
    high + 1 -> n -1 => contain 2 only

    to maintain the above rule we will move the mid pointer and check
    case 1:
    if (a[mid] == 0) {
        swap(a[mid], a[low]);
        mid++, low++;
    }
    case 2 : 
    if(a[mid] == 1) mid ++;

    case 3 :
        if(a[mid] == 2){
            swap(a[mid], a[high])
            high--;
        }
