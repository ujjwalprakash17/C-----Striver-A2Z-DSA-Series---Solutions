1. When the problem is based on intervals, where we need to find intervals
   type 1: minimum no of groups required to form non overlapping intervals.  
    maximum number of overlapping intervals at any time = minimum number of groups required, such that
   no two intervals should be overlapping.

2. Read about the concept of problem : Zero Array Transformation I
   Approach : Based on the inteval Value we need to find the number of occurance of elements in that interval for
   Ex : [[0, 2] , [1,4], [0, 5], [3, 5]] is poore interval me 1 kitni baar hai 0, kitni baar
   also both inclusive
   Solution : har interval ke starting index ko +1 kro aur ending element + 1 ko -1 kro
   for example
   index -> [0] => val = 1;
   index -> [3] => val = -1;
   aur aisa krte krte phir har ek element ko array ke each element ke prefixSum ke value se replace krte chalo
